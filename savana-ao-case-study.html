In addition to these pain points, there are federal compliances that must be followed and kept in mind during the design process.

                            I initially added all the options listed in the requirements for each field. As I collaborated with the product 
                            manager and client to better understand their customer base, I explored a more guided experience.

                            Through these discussions, I discovered that customers only needed a U.S. or Canadian residency address to 
                            open bank accounts with this specific client, so I simplified the process by just asking users for their country 
                            of residence. Based on their selection, relevant fields were dynamically populated.

                            buttons when there were fewer than three options, so users could see all choices right away without the need 
                            of the extra click to open a dropdown.

                            state. This way, users only have to enter their zip code, allowing us to auto-populate the city and state fields. 
                            This makes the process easier while helping to reduce potential human error.

                            We asked customers to create their online banking credentials in the application flow, allowing them to easily 
                            resume the application and eliminates the need to create credentials after the account is opened.

                A project this complex is sure to bring its fair share of challenges and redesigns. Regulatory hurdles and 
                evolving client needs presented compliance and design issues. Since both challenges required understanding 
                the customer’s role in their business or trust, we used similar redesigns and flow logic to address them.

                    New Federal Mandate
                    <span class="dp-step-description">
                        Coming from a previous position at a financial institution, I was already aware of many of the common pain points consumers face when opening accounts online. In addition to these pain points, there are federal compliances that must be followed and kept in mind during the design process.

                    Additional Client Requirement
                    <span class="dp-step-description">
                        This specific client introduced a requirement to include at least one grantor and trustee for all trust accounts.

                The design updates were implemented to align with new regulatory and client needs, and the revised designs 
                were handed over for full development. The client had a soft friends and family launch, which was a success, 
                receiving great feedback.
